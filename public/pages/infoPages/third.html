         When it comes to time, in coding, you have more than one way to get the time. </br>
         We were focusing on 3 types of "time calls".

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        When fetching data from an API, you need to use the fetch() method. </br>
        This method returns a promise, which is a placeholder for the data that will eventually be returned. </br>
        The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch.
    </p>
</div>

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        The fetch() method returns a promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. </br>
        The promise will reject with a typeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side. </br>
        The promise will resolve successfully, even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500.

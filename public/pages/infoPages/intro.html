    <p> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side runtime environment. It's build on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript, which was
        normally only used for client-side scripting. </p>
        When you install node.js, you have to get it from nodejs.org. From here you can choose which OS you need it for. 
    </p>
</div>

    <p> Node.js has an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This means it can handle a large number of connections easily. 
        This makes it a popular choice for building real-time, scalable applications such as web servers. </p>
        It comes with a rich set of built-in modules, such as HTTP, HTTPS. It also have a file system, that simplify the development of web applications. 
        Additionally, Node.js has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its modules. This makes it easy to find and use third-party libraries or help online. </p>
        To run files with Node.js, you have to open the terminal and write "node filename.js". Another good way is to install nodemon. When you start it, it will update the code every time you edit so 
        you don't have to keep on pressing "ctrl c" and write "node filename.js" all the time. </p>

    <h2> Here we looked at REST (Representational State Transfer) API conventions. </h2>
</div>

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> REST API conventions refer to the standard practices and guidelines for designing and building RESTfull APIs. We learned about REST last semester and had a lot of exercises on it. It was also a big part of the exam. 
        REST is a Spring annotation that is used to mark a class as REST controller. It's a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints and principles for creating web services. 
        The RESTcontroller is a combination of the Controller and ResponseBody annotation. 
        It indicates that the class is responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning the appropriate response. In a REST API, JSON is being sent.

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p>
        Some common REST API conventions is CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Like you see on the picture, we had to make a small exercise about it to show we knew how it was done.
        REST uses HTTP status codes such as 200 for OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request and 404 for Not Found. 
        If you haven't made a page yet, you can use a program called Postman, to see if you get the right responses on your update, delete and so on.

        JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that the type of a variable can change at runtime based on the value assigned to it. Here are the most common data types in JavaScript:

    <p>
        In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that holds a value, which can be a data type such as a number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object or symbol. 
        JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime.

    <p>
        Clean code and following code conventions is a good idea for several reasons. </p></br>
        1.	Efficiency: Writing clean code can save time in the long run, since it reduces the amount of time spent debugging and maintaining code, or trying to read it. This means that more time can be spent on developing new features or improving the code.</p>
        
        2.	Maintainability: Clean code is easier to maintain, since it is easier to understand, modify, and debug. This means that bugs can be fixed more quickly, and new features can be added more easily.</p>
        
        3.	Collaboration: Following code conventions makes it easier for developers to collaborate on a project. Consistent code means that developers can understand each other's code more easily, and work together more effectively.</p>
        
        4.	Readability: Clean code is easier to read and understand. Choose names that makes sense. It makes it easier for the developer who wrote it and for other developers who may use it or need to work on it. </br>Following code conventions makes code more consistent and predictable. This reduces the confusion and makes it easier to maintain and update.</p>
        
        5.	Professionalism: Writing clean code and following code conventions is a sign of professionalism, and demonstrates a commitment to producing high-quality, well-structured code. And people love to code with you.</p>

        We have been using GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) since 1 semester, and have tried to implement it in our code ever since. GRASP is a big part of clean and conventional coding.

    <p> 
        Server-side redirection and client-side redirection are two different approaches to redirecting a user from one URL to another. </br>
        Client-side redirection is done entirely on the client side, meaning that the redirect is handled by the browser rather than the server. </br>
        This is typically done using the HTML meta tag or the JavaScript window.location property. </br>
        The advantage of client-side redirection is that it can be done without making a request to the server, which can be faster and more efficient. </br>
        However, it has some limitations, such as the fact that it can only redirect to a single URL and it may not work if the user has JavaScript disabled. </br>

        Server-side redirection is done by the server before sending the response to the client. </br>
        This is typically done using HTTP status codes such as 301 (permanent redirect) or 302 (temporary redirect), which instruct the client to request a new URL. </br>
        The advantage of server-side redirection is that it can handle more complex redirect scenarios, such as redirecting based on user authentication or dynamically generating the redirect URL. </br>
        It also works reliably across different browsers and devices.

         This was a really nice method to learn about. </br>
         It helps a lot with structuring the HTML code and makes it easier to read and edit. </br>
         The picture below shows the structure of how the navbar(header), main(body) and footer is structured. </br>

        To make it work, you have split the "body" of the HTML up in 3. </br>
        A header, a main and a footer. </br>
        This way you can split it up in 3 different files. The header file ends with the start "main" tag </br>
        The body file will be empty, ready to get the HTML in you want to show. And then the footer starts with "/main" tag and ends the rest of the HTML. </br>
        This way you also get the same navbar and footer on every page since you normally don't edit that part on the different pages.

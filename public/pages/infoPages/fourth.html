        In JavaScript, exporting and importing are mechanisms used to share code between different modules in a frontend application. </br>
        We use it a lot in this project and as shown in the picture below, I use both in my template engine.

    <p> 
        Importing is the process of using exported code from another module in the current module. </br> 
        You can import exported code using the import statement followed by the name of the module and the exported name inside curly braces. </br>
        Exporting is the process of making variables, functions, or objects available outside of the current module. </br>
        You can export any JavaScript object using the export keyword before its definition. </br>
        Note that the exported and imported names must match exactly. </br> 
        You can also use the export default syntax to export a single object or function as the default export of a module, which can be imported using the import statement without the curly braces.

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        ES modules and CommonJS are two different module systems used in Node.js. </br>
        CommonJS was the original module system in Node.js, while ES modules are based on the ECMAScript specification. </br>
        CommonJS modules use the require() function to import modules and the module.exports object to export them. </br>
        ES modules, also known as "type modules", use the import and export keywords to import and export modules
    </p>

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        As seen on the picture above and throughout the project, I use ES modules. </br>
        In conclusion, CommonJS and ES modules are two different module systems used in Node.js. </br>
        While CommonJS is the older and more widely used system, ES modules offer several advantages, including better support for static analysis and better integration with modern JavaScript development tools.

    <h1> Welcome to Serving HTML. </h1>
    <h2> We have already covered some of the things we learned this week, in the page before (The First Server). </br>
            So instead im gonna focus on some different material and try to answer it as good as possible.</h2>

                                        <!-- Loops and loop methods in JS. -->

    <h1> - Loops - </h1>

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        In addition to the traditional for, while, and do-while loops, JavaScript also provides three loop methods that are commonly used when working with arrays: </br>
        map, filter, and reduce. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        MAP method: The map method allows you to iterate over each element in an array and apply a function to each element. </br> 
        It returns a new array with the same number of elements where each element is the result of the applied function.</p>
        FILTER method: The filter method allows you to iterate over each element in an array and return a new array containing only the elements that meet a specified condition.</p>
        REDUCE method: Reduce method allows you to iterate over each element in an array and then reduce it to a single value.</br> 
        It takes two arguments: a callback function (We talked about that in the "First Server" page), and an optional initial value.
    </p>

                                        <!-- Serving HTML in Express -->
<div class = "bodyTextTitle">
    <h1> - Serving HTML in Express - </h1>
</div>

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        As we talked about in the "First Server" page, Express is a web application framework for Node.js. </br>
        And we went through the process of creating a server and serving a simple HTML page. </br>
        But, if you wanna put CSS, images, and so on, you need to use the "static" method. </br>
    </p>
</div>

<img src="assets/images/static.jpg" alt="static" class="static">

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        As seen in the picture, is how it it used in this code. </br>
        Without it, the CSS and images wont be loaded on the page.
    </p>
</div>

                                        <!-- Node_module -->
<div class = "bodyTextTitle">
    <h1> - node_modules - </h1>
</div>

<div class = "bodyText">
    <p> 
        "node_modules" is a directory that is automatically created by Node.js when you install packages using the npm (Node Package Manager) command. </br> 
        This directory contains all the dependencies (third-party packages and modules) that your project needs to run. </br>
        When you install a package using npm, it gets installed in the node_modules directory of your project. </br>
        If the package has any dependencies of its own, those dependencies will also be installed in the node_modules directory, and so on. </br>
        This creates a tree-like structure of dependencies, with each package depending on one or more other packages.
    </p>

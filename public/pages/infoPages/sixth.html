        Server-side rendering is a technique for rendering web pages on the server before sending them to the client. </br>
        With SSR, the server generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a web page and sends it to the client as a complete HTML document. </br>
        The client can then render the page without having to wait for JavaScript to download and execute. </p>

        The advantages to using SSR, including: </p>
        1:	Improved performance: With SSR, the client can start rendering the page as soon as the HTML is received, without having to wait for JavaScript to load. </br>
        This can result in faster page load times and a better user experience, especially on slower devices or networks. </p>
        2:	Improved SEO: SSR can help search engines index your pages more easily. </p>
        3:	Easier to share: SSR can help you share a better link on your pages, social media and so on. </br>
                It shows a preview, and will look more safe, legit, and professional.. </p>
        4:	Accessibility: SSR can improve the accessibility of web pages by providing a complete HTML document that can be read by screen readers or other assistive technologies. </p>

        Server-side rendering also has some disadvantages tho. Like increased server load, since it has to generate the HTML for each request, and a more complex architecture that can make it more difficult to set up and maintain.
